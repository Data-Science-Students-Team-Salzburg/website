## <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">What we are</span>
We are a student initiative at the University of Salzburg, organized as an Ã–H 
club. Our team meets weekly to collaborate on data science challenges, fostering
skill development, teamwork, and practical problem-solving. Learn more about 
these challenges below!

## <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">What you get</span>
ðŸ’¡Learn from others and grow your skills. 

ðŸ§©Tackle real-world problems together. 

ðŸŽ¯Build a professional profile. 

## <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">What are data science challenges?</span>
Data science challenges are competitions where individuals or teams tackle 
real-world problems using data analysis, machine learning, and statistical 
techniques. Participants receive datasets and a specific goalâ€”such as predicting
outcomes, identifying patterns, or deriving insightsâ€”and work within time 
constraints to develop effective solutions. These challenges not only test 
skills in data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation but also often
offer prize money as a reward. They provide a unique opportunity to apply 
theoretical knowledge, gain experience with real-world data, and grow in the 
field of data science and machine learning. 

## <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">Why should I join a team?</span>
While itâ€™s true that you can tackle data science challenges alone from the 
comfort of your home, joining a team can significantly increase the chances of 
success. With multiple people, each bringing unique skills and perspectives, 
problem-solving becomes more robust and creative. We have the chance to learn
from each other, gaining insights that we might not reach on our own. Plus, 
working as a team makes the process more enjoyable, keeps motivation high, and 
adds a social element that turns challenges into a shared experience. 

## <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">Are there any requirements?</span>
Participants should ideally have foundational skills in data science, machine 
learning, and key tools in Python or R, such as data manipulation, 
visualization, and familiarity with core algorithms. Experience with GitHub and
model tuning is also helpful, but members can also grow these skills through 
practice in the club. If you are excited to apply, refine, and expand your 
skills with a motivated team, join our Data Science Team and take on these
challenges together! 

## <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">Where and when do we meet?</span>
We meet every Tuesday from 16:00 to 17:00 at 
[Hellbrunner StraÃŸe 34, 5020 Salzburg](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yq5Rmj2552xTAPFz7)
, on the third floor in the left half of the building, when looking at it 
from the front where the fountain is.

We use WhatsApp for general communication and organizational updates.

### **Discord**
For challenge-specific discussions, join our
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/zWwwqGTHKE).

### **GitHub**
We store all our code on our
[GitHub organization](https://github.com/Data-Science-Team-Salzburg). For each
challenge, a repository is created. Branches inside the repo provide the 
personal code storage for each participant. To get added, write an email to  
Thomas Rauter: <span id="email">thomas.rauter@plus.ac.at</span>  
<button onclick="copyEmail()" style="cursor:pointer; padding:5px 10px; background-color:#007BFF; color:white; border:none; border-radius:5px; font-size:14px;">
  Copy Email
</button>

<script>
function copyEmail() {
  const email = document.getElementById('email').innerText;
  navigator.clipboard.writeText(email).then(() => {
    alert('Email copied to clipboard!');
  });
}
</script>


### **Cloud storage**
The Ã–H offers us storage in their cloud. There, we can for example store the
datasets for each challenge, and other larger files. Access the cloud with this
link --> coming soon.

### **Cloud computing**
The Ã–H also offers us 300â‚¬ per year which we plan to use for cloud computing,
using Google Vertex AI. --> coming soon.

### **LinkedIn**
We also have a 
[LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/10046023/), where we share our 
successes. Feel free to repost any posts about the completion of a challenge you
participated in.
