# Meetings

Our meetings follow a structured timeplan to ensure efficiency and productive 
collaboration. Here's the breakdown:

## <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">Before the Meeting</span>
All team members should upload their results as a **PowerPoint presentation** to 
the cloud at least one day before the meeting. Each slide should be clearly 
described and easy to understand without needing an explanation. The 
**PowerPoint** files must be labeled in the following format:

**`year_month_day_your-name`**

This naming convention ensures that files are automatically sorted in a 
meaningful order.

Uploading the files in advance gives everyone enough time to review the results 
at their own pace and prepare any questions, which can then be asked during the 
first phase of the meeting.


## <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">Regular Meeting Schedule</span>
- **0-20 min:**  
  Ask questions about results uploaded to the cloud

- **20-40 min:**  
  Discuss new ideas and brainstorm potential approaches.

- **40-50 min:**  
  Formulate actionable tasks and assign responsibilities to team members.

- **50-60 min:**  
  Buffer time for any remaining discussions or clarifications.

## <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">Optional After-Meeting</span>
- **60-120 min (optional):**  
  For those interested, we hold an optional after-meeting to dive deeper into 
  specific topics, address challenges, or explore ideas in more detail.

## <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold;">Meeting Notes</span>
One person (usually Thomas Rauter) should take structured notes during the 
meeting to ensure key points are documented. The notes should follow this format:

---

### **Meeting Notes Format**
1. **What Everyone Did**  
   A brief summary of each participant's contributions or updates since the 
   last meeting.

2. **Discussion**  
   Key points discussed during the meeting, including any new ideas, 
   challenges, or brainstorming outcomes.

3. **Task Assignment**  
   A clear list of actionable tasks, including who is responsible for each task 
   and the deadlines.

---

After the meeting, these notes should be uploaded to the cloud so all team 
members can access them for reference.
